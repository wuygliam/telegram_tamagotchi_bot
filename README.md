# telegram_tamagotchi_bot
This is a telegram bot I created, where the user can interact with a virtual puppy and take care of it.

I used the official telegram APIs, along with a few others, in order to have two main threads: one that checks for interactions with the puppy and one that changes its vital signs with the passing time.

There are three times of interactions with two orders of magnitude each: food, drink and fun. None of its vital signs must go under 0, or above 10, else the puppy would die or escape in confusion.

This can be the structure for more complex interactions and animations.
